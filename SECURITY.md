# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Kappa is currently under active development and releases a new version
every 2-3 weeks. We always recommend users to move to a newer version
when it became available, and we only provide security updates in the 
latest version.

If you are using an older version of Kappa and would like to receive
security patches, let us know via
[Kappa Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/kappa/shared_invite/enQtNjcyMTY3MjE4NTgzLTU3ZDc1MWM5MzQxMWQxMzJiNTc1MTJmMzYzMTYwMjQ0OGEwNDFmZDkzYWQxNzgxYWNhNjAxZjk4MzI4OGY1Yjg)
or [Kappa Discussions](https://github.com/kappa/Kappa/discussions).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please do not share it publically on Github
nor the community slack channel. Instead, contact the Kappa team
directly via email first: contact@kappa.ai
