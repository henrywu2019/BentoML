Model Serving Made Easy
=======================

Kappa is a flexible, high-performance framework for serving, managing, and deploying machine learning models.

* Supports **Multiple ML frameworks**, including Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, XGBoost
  and :ref:`more <frameworks-page>`
* **Cloud native deployment** with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure and
  :ref:`many more <deployments-page>`
* **High-Performance** online API serving and offline batch serving
* Web dashboards and APIs for model registry and deployment management

Kappa bridges the gap between Data Science and DevOps. By providing a
standard interface for describing a prediction service, Kappa
abstracts away how to run model inference efficiently and how model
serving workloads can integrate with cloud infrastructures.
